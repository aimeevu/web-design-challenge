## GA Tech Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp Module 11
### Description
In this unit, we learn HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap and create a dashboard featuring the analysis that we did as part of Module 6. The visualizations and data generated from the <a href="https://github.com/aimeevu/python-api-challenge">Python API Challenge</a> is displayed on a GitHub Pages site in order to showcase our ability to create a website for our analysis.

You can view this site <a href="https://aimeevu.github.io/web-design-challenge/">here</a>.

As part of this module, we used Bootstrap styling in order to recreate a website in photos provided by the boot camp. We created a total of seven pages which included a landing page, a page for each four visualization, a comparison page, and a data page.

The landing page contains an explanation of the project. Each visualization contains the corresponding graph and description. The comparison page contains all four of the visualizations side by side. Finally, the data page contains a responsive table that contains the data used in the visualization.

The top of each page has a navigation and each of the visualization pages will also have a navigation pane that is linked to each of the other visualization pages. Once one of the pages is active, a colored square will surround that visualization.

### Submission Requirements
* Link to deployed app containing visualizations and analysis
